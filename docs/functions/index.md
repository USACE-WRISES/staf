# Stream Functions

Functions provide the stable backbone of the assessment. Metrics can change by tier or region, but functions define what you are trying to understand about stream condition.

## Functions list (static fallback)
If the interactive explorer does not load, use the table below.

| Function | Short description |
|---|---|
| Catchment hydrology | Land uses alter water quantity and quality delivered to the stream. |
| Surface water storage | Natural or artificial storage attenuates flows and increases residence time. |
| Reach inflow | Local inputs change magnitude, timing, and quality of flow. |
| Streamflow regime | The characteristic flow pattern shaping habitat and transport. |
| Low flow and baseflow dynamics | Maintains wetted habitat and moderates conditions during low water. |
| High flow dynamics | Drives erosion and channel maintenance during peaks. |
| Floodplain connectivity | Lateral exchange supports nutrient cycling and habitat. |
| Hyporheic connectivity | Surface-subsurface exchange supports temperature and nutrient regulation. |
| Channel evolution | Changes in channel dimensions and slope reflecting adjustment. |
| Channel and floodplain dynamics | Bank processes and planform dynamics that affect complexity. |
| Sediment continuity | Balanced sediment supply and transport maintaining form and habitat. |
| Bed composition and bedform dynamics | Substrate and bedforms (and wood effects) supporting habitat and exchange. |
| Light and thermal regime | Regulates temperature and energy inputs shaping chemistry. |
| Carbon processing | Organic matter dynamics supporting food webs and metabolism. |
| Nutrient cycling | N and P transformations controlling productivity and water quality. |
| Water and soil quality | Contaminants and constituents influencing chemical condition. |
| Habitat provision | Physical habitat diversity supporting life stages and taxa. |
| Population support | Survival, reproduction, and movement of key taxa. |
| Community dynamics | Balanced assemblages of native taxa and resilience. |
| Watershed connectivity | Longitudinal and lateral connectivity enabling recovery. |
