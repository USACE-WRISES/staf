# Screening Tier

<div class="button-row">

</div>

## Workflow steps
1. Delineate reaches and catchments.
2. Compute a small set of desktop metrics.
3. Convert raw values to standardized scores.
4. Roll up to outcomes and overall condition.
5. Flag high-potential sites for Rapid tier work.

## How scoring works at this tier
Use a single proxy metric per function when possible. Document scoring thresholds and note uncertainty.

<div class="factsheet-card">
  <p class="factsheet-card-text">Use the widget to try the default screening assessment or build your own. You can score metrics, and then scores are automatically rolled up into function scores, outcome sub-indices, and an overall ecosystem condition index.</p>
