## Workflow steps
1. Delineate reaches and catchments.
2. Compute or complete screening metrics and convert to metric values (e.g., Good, Fair, Poor) based on scoring criteria for metric.
3. Assign a Function Score based on the Metric Values and suggested range.

## How scoring works at this tier
Use a single proxy metric per function. User scores functions based on metric values.

<div class="factsheet-card">
  <p class="factsheet-card-text">Use the widget to try the default screening assessment or build your own. You can score metrics, and then scores are automatically rolled up into function scores, outcome sub-indices, and an overall ecosystem condition index.</p>
