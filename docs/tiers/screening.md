## Screening-Level Assessment Development
Use the widget to try the default screening assessment or build your own. You can score metrics, and then scores are automatically rolled up into function scores, outcome sub-indices, and an overall ecosystem condition index.

{% include screening_assessment_widget.html %}

## When to use
- Watershed screening and prioritization
- Early project planning across many sites
- Low-risk decisions where higher uncertainty is acceptable

## What you get (outputs)
- Function scores with clear uncertainty notes
- Outcome indices (physical, chemical, biological)
- Ranked list of candidate reaches for follow-on tiers

## What it costs (effort/resources)
- Minutes to hours per site
- Primarily desktop time with optional field verification
- Minimal specialized equipment or lab analysis

## Typical data inputs
- GIS land cover and impervious surface
- Remote sensing and imagery
- National datasets and existing reports

## Workflow steps
1. Delineate reaches and catchments.
2. Compute a small set of desktop metrics.
3. Convert raw values to standardized scores.
4. Roll up to outcomes and overall condition.
5. Flag high-potential sites for Rapid tier work.

## How scoring works at this tier
Use a single proxy metric per function when possible. Document scoring thresholds and note uncertainty. Weighting and roll-up logic should mirror the standard scoring pipeline described in the scoring page.
