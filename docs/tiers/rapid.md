## Rapid Assessment Widget (SFARI)
Use the widget to review indicators, set function scores, and see how scores roll up into outcome sub-indices and the overall ecosystem condition index.

{% include rapid_assessment_widget.html %}

## When to use
- Comparing multiple candidate sites
- Alternatives evaluation or conceptual design support
- Validating Screening-tier results with field evidence

## What you get (outputs)
- Semi-quantitative function and outcome scores
- Structured field observations with photo documentation
- Clear comparison across reaches and alternatives

## What it costs (effort/resources)
- Hours to one day per reach
- Trained field staff and standard field kit
- Limited lab analysis

## Typical data inputs
- Structured field forms and checklists
- Simple channel and habitat measurements
- Screening-tier metrics for context

## Workflow steps
1. Review Screening results to target field effort.
2. Apply the rapid field protocol and record observations.
3. Compute function scores using a scoring workbook.
4. Compare alternatives and document constraints.

## How scoring works at this tier
Combine multiple rapid field metrics per function as needed. Screening metrics can be retained for context but should not overwhelm field-based indicators.
