# Rapid Tier

## Workflow steps
1. Review Screening results to target field effort.
2. Apply the rapid field protocol and record observations.
3. Compute function scores using a scoring workbook.
4. Compare alternatives and document constraints.

## How scoring works at this tier
Combine multiple rapid field metrics per function as needed. Screening metrics can be retained for context but should not overwhelm field-based indicators.

<div class="factsheet-card">
  <p class="factsheet-card-text">Use the widget to review indicators, set function scores, and see how scores roll up into outcome sub-indices and the overall ecosystem condition index.</p>
