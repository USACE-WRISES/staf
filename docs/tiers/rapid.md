## Workflow steps
1. User will apply the Stream Functions Assessment and Rapid Index (SFARI) assessment.
2. Collect desktop metrics to support rapid assessment.
3. Perform field visit and complete metric scores based on level of agreement with metric statements.
4. User scores functions based on lines of evidence (metric scores) and the Function Statement.

## How scoring works at this tier
Combine multiple rapid field metrics per function as needed. User scores functions based on multiple lines of evidence from metric scores.

<div class="factsheet-card">
  <p class="factsheet-card-text">Use the widget to score indicators, set function scores based on agreement with function statement, and see how scores roll up to ecosystem condition index.</p>
</div>
