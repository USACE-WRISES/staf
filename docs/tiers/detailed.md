## When to use
- High-risk decisions and regulatory compliance
- Mitigation crediting or debiting
- Post-construction monitoring and performance verification

## What you get (outputs)
- Defensible, lower-uncertainty function scores
- Calibrated reference curves and thresholds
- Full documentation suitable for review

## What it costs (effort/resources)
- Multiple days to weeks per site
- Specialized equipment, lab analysis, and modeling
- Higher staffing and QA/QC requirements

## Typical data inputs
- Intensive field surveys and monitoring
- Water quality and biological sampling
- Regional reference datasets and models

## Workflow steps
1. Define detailed questions and performance standards.
2. Build or adopt a regional reference network.
3. Collect intensive field and lab data.
4. Calibrate scoring curves and thresholds.
5. Compute function and outcome scores with uncertainty.

## How scoring works at this tier
Use direct measurements where feasible and calibrate scoring curves to regional reference conditions. Document uncertainty and perform sensitivity checks.

## Regional Models Library
