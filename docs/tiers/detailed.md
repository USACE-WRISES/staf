## Workflow steps
1. Build or adopt a regional reference network (e.g., calibrate scoring curves and thresholds).
2. Collect intensive field, lab, modeling data based required for metrics.
3. Enter metric values into calculator/widget to calculate Function Scores based on reference curves.

## How scoring works at this tier
User may use multiple detailed metrics as needed to characterize the function. Reference curves are used to convert the metric value to a function score.

<div class="factsheet-card">
  <p class="factsheet-card-text">Use the widget to build detailed assessments, enter field values, and translate them into metric index scores using reference curves. Function scores and outcome sub-indices roll up automatically.</p>
</div>
