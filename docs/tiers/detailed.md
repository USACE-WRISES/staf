# Detailed Tier

<div class="button-row">

</div>

## Workflow steps
1. Define detailed questions and performance standards.
2. Build or adopt a regional reference network.
3. Collect intensive field and lab data.
4. Calibrate scoring curves and thresholds.
5. Compute function and outcome scores with uncertainty.

## How scoring works at this tier
Use direct measurements where feasible and calibrate scoring curves to regional reference conditions. Document uncertainty and perform sensitivity checks.

<div class="factsheet-card">
  <p class="factsheet-card-text">Use the widget to build detailed assessments, enter field values, and translate them into metric index scores using reference curves. Function scores and outcome sub-indices roll up automatically.</p>
</div>
