    "content": "Stream assessment practice faces recurring challenges: . | Too many methods, scattered across sources. Hundreds of assessment methods exist (many in ï¿½grey literatureï¿½), so locating and comparing approaches is inefficient. | Inconsistent metric choices and terminology. Different tools measure different things, often without a shared structure that makes gaps and overlaps visible. | Wide variation in resources required. Some assessments take minutes; others require weeks of field sampling and analysis. Level of effort is often not clearly tracked or used in selection. | Limited comparability of results across methods and regions. Different function coverage, different scoring structures, and different output formats make it hard to compare ï¿½like with like.ï¿½ | . The Tiered Approach addresses these issues by: . | using a shared functions framework (common vocabulary + comprehensive coverage), | defining explicit levels of effort (Screening, Rapid, Detailed), | mapping functions to Clean Water Act outcome framing (physical, chemical, biological integrity), | providing repeatable scoring and aggregation so results remain comparable across tiers and over time. | .

    "content": "Why functions (instead of only metrics) . Metrics differ by region, program, and available data. Functions provide the stable ï¿½spineï¿½ of assessment because they: . | keep assessment focused on ecological processes that matter (not only what is easy to measure), | reveal gaps and overlaps among tools, | create a shared vocabulary for communication, | support comparability across projects and tiers. | . Functional categories used in this approach . This framework groups functions into five categories aligned with a widely used disciplinary structure: . | Hydrology (watershed-scale water generation, storage, and delivery) | Hydraulics (reach-scale movement of water in channel/floodplain/subsurface pathways) | Geomorphology (sediment/wood transport and channel form dynamics) | Physicochemistry (light/heat/carbon/nutrients/contaminants that shape chemical template) | Biology (habitat, populations, communities, and connectivity) | . The 20 core stream functions . These 20 functions are intended as a comprehensive starting point. Regional tools may consolidate or tailor the list, but changes should be documented and traceable back to these functions to preserve comparability. Hydrology (4) . | Catchment hydrology ï¿½ Land uses alter water quantity and quality delivered to the stream. | Surface water storage ï¿½ Natural/artificial storage attenuates flows and increases residence time. | Reach inflow ï¿½ Localized inputs (tributaries, ditches, pipes) alter magnitude/timing/quality. | Streamflow regime ï¿½ The characteristic flow pattern that shapes habitat, transport, and water quality. | . Hydraulics (4) . | Low flow and baseflow dynamics ï¿½ Maintains wetted habitat and modulates temperature/chemistry during low water. | High flow dynamics ï¿½ Drives erosion and channel maintenance during storms and peaks. | Floodplain connectivity ï¿½ Lateral exchange supports nutrient cycling, habitat, and hydraulic relief. | Hyporheic connectivity ï¿½ Surfaceï¿½subsurface exchange supports temperature regulation, nutrients, and habitat. | . Geomorphology (4) . | Channel evolution ï¿½ Changes in channel dimension/slope reflecting legacy and ongoing adjustment. | Channel and floodplain dynamics ï¿½ Bank processes, planform dynamics, and curvature that affect complexity. | Sediment continuity ï¿½ Balanced sediment supply and transport that maintains form and habitat. | Bed composition and bedform dynamics ï¿½ Substrate and bedforms (and wood effects) supporting habitat and exchange. | . Physicochemistry (4) . | Light &amp; thermal regime ï¿½ Regulates temperature and energy inputs shaping chemistry and niches. | Carbon processing ï¿½ Organic matter dynamics supporting food webs and system metabolism. | Nutrient cycling ï¿½ N and P transformations controlling productivity and water quality. | Water &amp; soil quality ï¿½ Contaminants/constituents influencing chemical condition and biotic health. | . Biology (4) . | Habitat provision ï¿½ Physical habitat diversity supporting life stages and taxa. | Population support ï¿½ Survival, reproduction, and movement of key taxa. | Community dynamics ï¿½ Balanced assemblages of native taxa; invasive pressure; resilience. | Watershed connectivity ï¿½ Longitudinal/lateral connectivity enabling colonization and recovery. | .

Includes Add button. - Minimum Tier: Lowest tier where the metric is available. - Scoring: Shows \"X Curves\" plus an expander glyph. - Details: Button to open Details tab in the inspector. ### X Curves behavior - Text \"X Curves\" selects the metric and opens the Curves tab. - The glyph toggles expansion in-row only. - Expanded state lists curve names. - Clicking a curve name opens Curves tab and selects that curve. - When tier filter is Screening/Rapid/Detailed: X uses that tier's profile curves. - When tier filter is All: X is total curves across profiles. ## Right sidebar (Metric Inspector) Tabs: - Details: Method/Context, How to measure, curves summary + button to open Curves tab. - Scoring: Renders rubric based on scoring type (categorical/thresholds/curve/formula). - Curves: Embedded builder for selecting and editing curves. ### Profile selection rules Default profile selection: 1. If current tier filter is Screening/Rapid/Detailed and that profile exists, use it. 2. Else if a profile is marked `recommended=true`, use it. 3. Else use the first profile. ## QA checklist - Open Screening page -> open library -> filter to Screening -> expand curves -> click curve name -> Curves tab opens. - Repeat on Rapid and Detailed pages. - Add a Detailed profile metric while on Screening page (profile picker). - If a profile has 0 curves, Curves tab shows \"Create curve\" state and Add is disabled if curves are required. - Added metrics show \"Added\" state in the library list and inspector header.

    "content": "# Metric Library ## Overview The metric library is the canonical dataset used by Screening, Rapid, and Detailed widgets. It stores metric definitions, profile scoring rules, and reference curves in one place. ## Folder layout ``` docs/assets/data/metric-library/ index.json rating-scales.json metrics/ .json curves/ .json ``` ## Primary workflow (recommended) Use the source CSV as the single input and regenerate all metric-library outputs. 1. Update CSV in: - `docs/assets/data/metric-library/Metric Library Complete *.csv` 2. Build library: ```bash npm run build:metric-library ``` 3. Validate: ```bash npm test ``` The build command runs `scripts/compileMetricLibraryFromCsv.ts` and regenerates: - Canonical metric library JSON (`index.json`, `metrics/*.json`, `curves/*.json`) - Tier files (`screening-metrics.tsv`, `rapid-indicators.tsv`, `rapid-criteria.tsv`, `detailed-metrics.tsv`) - Source-rich TSV variants and `_site` mirrors. ## Alternative run options Run the compiler directly: ```bash npx ts-node scripts/compileMetricLibraryFromCsv.ts ``` Use a specific CSV file: ```powershell $env:METRIC_LIBRARY_CSV_PATH = \"docs/assets/data/metric-library/Metric Library Complete 2026-02-10.csv\" npm run build:metric-library ``` ## Metric Library download (XLSX) The in-app **Metric Library download** button exports an Excel workbook with: - `Metrics` tab - `Reference Curves` tab That workbook is generated in the browser from canonical JSON metric-library files (`index.json`, `metrics/*.json`, `curves/*.json`). It is not rebuilt from TSV files. ## Manual JSON edits (advanced) If you edit `metrics/*.json` or `curves/*.json` directly, rebuild only the index with: ```bash npm run build:metric-index ``` ## Legacy migration scripts Older migration scripts remain available: - `npm run migrate:screening-metrics` - `npm run migrate:detailed-metrics` Use them only for legacy conversions; prefer the CSV-first workflow above.
