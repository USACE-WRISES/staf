Hundreds of assessment methods exist (many in ï¿½grey literatureï¿½), so locating and comparing approaches is inefficient. | Inconsistent metric choices and terminology. Different tools measure different things, often without a shared structure that makes gaps and overlaps visible. | Wide variation in resources required. Some assessments take minutes; others require weeks of field sampling and analysis. Level of effort is often not clearly tracked or used in selection. | Limited comparability of results across methods and regions. Different function coverage, different scoring structures, and different output formats make it hard to compare ï¿½like with like.ï¿½ | . The Tiered Approach addresses these issues by: . | using a shared functions framework (common vocabulary + comprehensive coverage), | defining explicit levels of effort (Screening, Rapid, Detailed), | mapping functions to Clean Water Act outcome framing (physical, chemical, biological integrity), | providing repeatable scoring and aggregation so results remain comparable across tiers and over time. | .

Functions provide the stable ï¿½spineï¿½ of assessment because they: . | keep assessment focused on ecological processes that matter (not only what is easy to measure), | reveal gaps and overlaps among tools, | create a shared vocabulary for communication, | support comparability across projects and tiers. | . Functional categories used in this approach . This framework groups functions into five categories aligned with a widely used disciplinary structure: . | Hydrology (watershed-scale water generation, storage, and delivery) | Hydraulics (reach-scale movement of water in channel/floodplain/subsurface pathways) | Geomorphology (sediment/wood transport and channel form dynamics) | Physicochemistry (light/heat/carbon/nutrients/contaminants that shape chemical template) | Biology (habitat, populations, communities, and connectivity) | . The 20 core stream functions . These 20 functions are intended as a comprehensive starting point. Regional tools may consolidate or tailor the list, but changes should be documented and traceable back to these functions to preserve comparability. Hydrology (4) . | Catchment hydrology ï¿½ Land uses alter water quantity and quality delivered to the stream. | Surface water storage ï¿½ Natural/artificial storage attenuates flows and increases residence time. | Reach inflow ï¿½ Localized inputs (tributaries, ditches, pipes) alter magnitude/timing/quality. | Streamflow regime ï¿½ The characteristic flow pattern that shapes habitat, transport, and water quality. | . Hydraulics (4) . | Low flow and baseflow dynamics ï¿½ Maintains wetted habitat and modulates temperature/chemistry during low water. | High flow dynamics ï¿½ Drives erosion and channel maintenance during storms and peaks. | Floodplain connectivity ï¿½ Lateral exchange supports nutrient cycling, habitat, and hydraulic relief. | Hyporheic connectivity ï¿½ Surfaceï¿½subsurface exchange supports temperature regulation, nutrients, and habitat. | . Geomorphology (4) . | Channel evolution ï¿½ Changes in channel dimension/slope reflecting legacy and ongoing adjustment. | Channel and floodplain dynamics ï¿½ Bank processes, planform dynamics, and curvature that affect complexity. | Sediment continuity ï¿½ Balanced sediment supply and transport that maintains form and habitat. | Bed composition and bedform dynamics ï¿½ Substrate and bedforms (and wood effects) supporting habitat and exchange. | . Physicochemistry (4) . | Light &amp; thermal regime ï¿½ Regulates temperature and energy inputs shaping chemistry and niches. | Carbon processing ï¿½ Organic matter dynamics supporting food webs and system metabolism. | Nutrient cycling ï¿½ N and P transformations controlling productivity and water quality. | Water &amp; soil quality ï¿½ Contaminants/constituents influencing chemical condition and biotic health. | . Biology (4) . | Habitat provision ï¿½ Physical habitat diversity supporting life stages and taxa. | Population support ï¿½ Survival, reproduction, and movement of key taxa. | Community dynamics ï¿½ Balanced assemblages of native taxa; invasive pressure; resilience. | Watershed connectivity ï¿½ Longitudinal/lateral connectivity enabling colonization and recovery. | .
