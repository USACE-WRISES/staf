  "descriptionMarkdown": "\"Evaluates whether the reach maintains adequate wetted depth and continuity during low flow by integrating pool depth, wetted length, exposed bed, and Q90/Q10 differences. Extent to which water remains in contact with both banks and low benches during low flow, sustaining edge habitat and exchange.\"",
  "methodContextMarkdown": "Context: Channel\n\nMethod: Field",
  "howToMeasureMarkdown": "\"Estimate percent of channel length wetted at typical low-flow conditions and document with photos where feasible. Count pools that remain connected versus isolated at low flow and note dominant disconnection causes. Estimate percent of bed exposed during low flow using field photos or dry-season imagery where available.\"",
