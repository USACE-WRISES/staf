  "functionStatement": "Frequent overbank flows reduce flood peaks, support riparian vegetation, create off-channel refugia, and extend nutrient processing time.",
  "descriptionMarkdown": "Stable, not heavily dredged/incised, allowing normal overbank flows/meanders unless dredging is historical.\nChannel is not deeply incised; moderate floods access a broad floodplain, matching reference conditions.\n1-2 yr floods routinely access the floodplain, matching reference inundation patterns.",
  "methodContextMarkdown": "Context: Channel; Floodplain\n\nMethod: Field; Desktop",
  "howToMeasureMarkdown": "Identify incision, dredging, levees, and spoil banks from imagery and confirm in the field or with historical sources where feasible.\nCompute entrenchment ratio as flood-prone width (often about 2x bankfull depth) divided by bankfull width using DEM or LiDAR cross sections and bankfull indicators.\nMap bankfull inundation extent using a DEM and bankfull flow estimate and compare to mapped floodplain layers as a proxy for moderate-flood access.",
