  "functionStatement": "Frequent overbank flows reduce flood peaks, support riparian vegetation, create off-channel refugia, and extend nutrient processing time.",
  "descriptionMarkdown": "\"Stable, not heavily dredged/incised, allowing normal overbank flows/meanders unless dredging is historical. Channel is not deeply incised; moderate floods access a broad floodplain, matching reference conditions. 1-2 yr floods routinely access the floodplain, matching reference inundation patterns.\"",
  "methodContextMarkdown": "Context: Channel; Floodplain\n\nMethod: Field; Desktop",
  "howToMeasureMarkdown": "\"Identify incision, dredging, levees, and spoil banks from imagery and confirm in the field or with historical sources where feasible. Compute entrenchment ratio as flood-prone width (often about 2x bankfull depth) divided by bankfull width using DEM or LiDAR cross sections and bankfull indicators. Map bankfull inundation extent using a DEM and bankfull flow estimate and compare to mapped floodplain layers as a proxy for moderate-flood access.\"",
