  "function": "High flow dynamics",
  "functionStatement": "Peak flows reshape channel without chronic instability, redistribute wood and sediment, reset habitats, and supply nutrients to floodplains.",
  "descriptionMarkdown": "Bed sediments mobilize near bankfull (~1-2 yr), maintaining a stable but dynamic channel.\nBankfull floods do not cause excessive scour/fill; channel handles transport without frequent failures.\nBankfull shear stress fits substrate/banks, indicating stable capacity.",
  "methodContextMarkdown": "Context: Channel\n\nMethod: Desktop; Field",
  "howToMeasureMarkdown": "Estimate critical discharge from Shields using D50 and compare to flood recurrence estimates. Use qualitative checks where data are limited.\nUse imagery change detection to identify fresh bars or scour after moderate floods and confirm in the field where possible.\nCompare bankfull width and depth to regional curves for drainage area and slope and flag large departures.",
