  "descriptionMarkdown": "\"Fine sediment deposition/embeddedness as an indicator of sediment imbalance and habitat condition for benthic organisms and fish spawning. Presence and clarity of expected bedform sequence (riffle-run-pool or step-pool) indicate organized transport and habitat variety. Combines substrate size distribution, embeddedness, and consolidation or armoring to assess pore space and habitat quality.\"",

  "howToMeasureMarkdown": "\"Conduct a field screening to visually estimate fine sediment deposition or embeddedness in representative riffles/runs, or use an approved protocol referenced by the applicable SQT. Assign the condition class using the bin thresholds for this metric. Perform a pebble count to estimate percent gravel and cobble versus fines. Estimate percent of coarse grains buried by fines during a field visit. Use a pick test or visual checks to identify surface crusting, cementing, or heavy armoring. Visually classify dominant substrate along the reach (bedrock, boulder, cobble, gravel, sand, silt or clay) and note the relative amount of fines and embedding.\"",
