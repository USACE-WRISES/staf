  "descriptionMarkdown": "\"Road/trail proximity or density as an indicator of watershed development and potential sediment/pollutant delivery. Distance from the project reach to the nearest road and/or planned road expansion. Closer roads can increase stormwater inputs, constrain floodplains, and contribute sediment and pollutants. Road density within the contributing watershed or buffer. Higher road density can increase runoff, fragment riparian areas, and deliver sediment/pollutants. Degree of land development/disturbance in the watershed and/or near the project reach (e.g., urban areas, industrial sites, oil/gas, mining, timber harvest). Increased development can alter runoff, sediment delivery, and water quality.\"",

Assign the condition class using the bin thresholds for this metric. Measure the minimum distance from the project reach (or riparian buffer) to mapped roads using GIS and/or recent imagery. Where specified, incorporate information on proposed road expansion. Assign the condition class using the bin thresholds for this metric. Using a roads GIS layer, calculate total road length divided by watershed area (or within the specified buffer). Assign the condition class using the bin thresholds for this metric. Review recent imagery and available land use/permit data to characterize development intensity in the watershed and within the specified distance of the project reach (e.g., 1 mile). Assign the condition class using the bin thresholds for this metric.\"",
