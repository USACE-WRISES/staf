# Scoring and Condition

This page explains how function scores roll up into outcome sub-indices, and an overall ecosystem condition index.

## Scoring approach
1. Metrics are scored on a common scale and rolled up into function scores (metrics are tier-specific; see tier pages for metric guidance).
2. Function scores roll up to outcome indices (physical, chemical, biological).
3. Physical, Chemical, and Biological Outcome sub-indices are normalized to 0–1 by dividing by 15.
4. The Ecosystem Condition Index is the average of the three indices.

**Function score scale:** 0 to 15.
**Outcome index scale:** 0 to 1 (score divided by 15, rounded to 2 decimals).

## Outcomes
- **Physical outcome** focuses on hydrology, hydraulics, and geomorphic structure.
- **Chemical outcome** focuses on thermal regime, nutrients, and water quality.
- **Biological outcome** focuses on habitat, populations, and community dynamics.
