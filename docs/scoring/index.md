## Scoring approach
1. Metrics are scored on a common scale and rolled up into function scores (metrics are tier-specific; see tier pages for metric guidance).
2. Function scores (scale: 0 to 15) roll up to outcome indices (physical, chemical, biological).
3. Physical, Chemical, and Biological Outcome sub-indices are normalized to 0–1 by dividing by 15 (rounded to 2 decimals).
4. The Ecosystem Condition Index (scale: 0 to 1) is the average of the three outcome indices.

## Results
- **Physical outcome** focuses on hydrology, hydraulics, and geomorphic functions.
- **Chemical outcome** focuses on thermal regime, nutrients, and water quality.
- **Biological outcome** focuses on habitat, populations, and community dynamics.
- **Ecosystem condition (overall)** is the combined average of the physical, chemical, and biological outcome indices.
