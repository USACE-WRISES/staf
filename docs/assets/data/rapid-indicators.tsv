Biology	Community dynamics	Species interactions sustain biodiversity, restrain invasives, and build resilience to disturbance.	Keystone Species Presence	Species like beaver, unionid mussels, large crayfish persist if historically common, unless absent regionally.

Biology	Community dynamics	Species interactions sustain biodiversity, restrain invasives, and build resilience to disturbance.	Macroinvertebrate taxa richness	Quick sample shows multiple families (incl. EPT) unless dryness/high-altitude limits diversity.	Channel	Field	Compute major group richness from a kick-net sample or use existing biological records where available.	community-dynamics-macroinvertebrate-taxa-richness
Biology	Community dynamics	Species interactions sustain biodiversity, restrain invasives, and build resilience to disturbance.	Native species presence	Most historically native fish/inverts remain, unless naturally low-diversity (headwaters, ephemeral).	Channel	Field	Compare observed fish and invertebrate lists to available historical records or reference expectations.	community-dynamics-native-species-presence
Biology	Community dynamics	Species interactions sustain biodiversity, restrain invasives, and build resilience to disturbance.	Riparian buffer width	~30 m or appropriate for shade/leaf input if historically expected, unless narrower is normal (prairie).	Floodplain	Desktop	Measure riparian buffer width and vegetation structure in GIS along the reach.	community-dynamics-riparian-buffer-width
Biology	Watershed connectivity	Continuous pathways for free movement of water, sediment, and organisms supporting recolonization, maintaining species diversity, and enabling recovery.	Dewatered / Intermittent Segments	No artificial dryness in a historically perennial system, unless ephemeral dryness is normal.

Lateral Connectivity for Riparian Fauna	Floodplain/wetlands accessible for semiaquatic fauna unless steep canyons preclude it.	Floodplain	Field	Map levees or berms along the corridor and summarize continuous barrier length. Confirm passable gaps where present.	watershed-connectivity-lateral-connectivity-for-riparian-fauna
