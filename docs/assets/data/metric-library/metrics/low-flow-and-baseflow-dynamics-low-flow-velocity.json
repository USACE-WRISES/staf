  "functionStatement": "Ensures habitat availability and water quality during low water levels, and indicates non-storm conditions experienced the majority of the time.",

  "howToMeasureMarkdown": "Measure velocity with float or ADV, estimate via Manning with low-flow discharge, slope, and roughness, or use a simple model. Evaluate baseflow patterns and timing with hydrograph separation or IHA/EflowStats and compare to reference or regional low-flow stats.",
