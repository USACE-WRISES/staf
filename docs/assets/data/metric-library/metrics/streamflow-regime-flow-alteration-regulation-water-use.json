  "functionStatement": "Streamflow regime integrates the range of flows experienced by other processes and supports channel form, habitat diversity, and ecological life-cycle cues.\n\"Integrates the range of \"\"typical\"\" flows experienced by other processes. Examines the degree to which upstream infrastructure or land uses have fundamentally altered flow regimes (e.g., hydropeaking, dams, withdrawals).\"",
  "descriptionMarkdown": "Degree of alteration in flow magnitude, timing, duration, or permanence relative to natural conditions due to regulation, withdrawals/returns, or watershed change.\nCompares current daily-flow pattern to the natural regime, combining IHA metrics with the Richards-Baker flashiness index to screen for alteration from dams, withdrawals, or urbanization.",
  "methodContextMarkdown": "Context: Channel\n\nMethod: Desktop (gage/records) with field verification where feasible; Desktop",
  "howToMeasureMarkdown": "Use available flow records (gage data), modeled natural baseline estimates, and/or water-use/rights information to estimate change from expected natural conditions for the metric definition. Assign the condition class using the bin thresholds for this metric.\nCompare current mean annual flow to a natural or historical baseline and report percent difference.",
