  "howToMeasureMarkdown": "Compute a flashiness metric (e.g., Richards�Baker Flashiness Index) from daily (or finer) discharge data, or apply a watershed proxy (e.g., curve number) where specified. Compare to reference conditions/quartiles and assign the condition class using the bin thresholds for this metric.",
