  "function": "Channel and floodplain dynamics",
  "functionStatement": "Examines the role of bank processes and erosion in channel change. Observes patterns in sinuosity and curvature affecting habitat complexity.",
  "descriptionMarkdown": "Compares meander migration rates and cutoff frequency to reference behavior; excessive migration or avulsions indicate instability.\nIntegrates bank geometry, rooting, surface protection, raw or failing banks, and hardening to summarize erosion risk and sediment delivery.\nAssesses whether planform and number of active threads match the natural setting, considering straightening, braiding, and side-channel connectivity.\nRatio of channel length to valley length; higher sinuosity indicates greater curvature and habitat variety.",
  "methodContextMarkdown": "Context: Channel; Floodplain\n\nMethod: Desktop; Field",
  "howToMeasureMarkdown": "Count active threads at observed stage and compare to expected channel type. Use a DEM to corroborate bar and corridor patterns.\nCompile an imagery time series to map cutoff and avulsion locations and summarize frequency over decades.\nMap connected side channels and verify likely connection thresholds at about bankfull stage using field checks or elevation profiles.\nCompute channel centerline length divided by valley length in GIS.",
