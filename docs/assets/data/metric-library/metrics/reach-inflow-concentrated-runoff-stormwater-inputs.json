  "howToMeasureMarkdown": "Use available GIS layers/imagery and/or a field screening (as applicable) to quantify or rate the metric according to the provided bin thresholds.\nCount road or highway drainage outfalls per 100 m and note erosion or sediment plumes. Corroborate with available transportation layers if present.",
