  "descriptionMarkdown": "\"Bed sediments mobilize near bankfull (~1-2 yr), maintaining a stable but dynamic channel. Bankfull floods do not cause excessive scour/fill; channel handles transport without frequent failures. Bankfull shear stress fits substrate/banks, indicating stable capacity.\"",

  "howToMeasureMarkdown": "\"Estimate critical discharge from Shields using D50 and compare to flood recurrence estimates. Use qualitative checks where data are limited. Use imagery change detection to identify fresh bars or scour after moderate floods and confirm in the field where possible. Compare bankfull width and depth to regional curves for drainage area and slope and flag large departures.\"",
