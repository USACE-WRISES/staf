  "discipline": "Hydrology",
  "function": "Streamflow Regime",
  "functionStatement": "Integrates the range of \"typical\" flows experienced by other processes. Examines the degree to which upstream infrastructure or land uses have fundamentally altered flow regimes (e.g., hydropeaking, dams, withdrawals).",
  "descriptionMarkdown": "Flow permanence describes whether overall flow duration (ephemeral, intermittent, or perennial) and baseflow conditions match the expected natural regime, using SDAM class, streambed vegetation indicators, mean annual flow statistics, and where available, flowing-days data.",
  "methodContextMarkdown": "Context: C\n\nMethod: F",
  "howToMeasureMarkdown": "Use weight-of-evidence: (1) apply regional SDAM to classify flow duration; (2) estimate streambed rooted-vegetation cover/type and compare to expected class; (3) compare current vs baseline mean annual flow (percent difference); (4) where available, compute annual flowing days from loggers or gages and compare to reference. Score based on consistency across lines of evidence.",
