  "functionStatement": "Integrates the range of \"typical\" flows experienced by other processes. Examines the degree to which upstream infrastructure or land uses have fundamentally altered flow regimes (e.g., hydropeaking, dams, withdrawals).",
  "descriptionMarkdown": "Compares current daily-flow pattern to the natural regime, combining IHA metrics with the Richards-Baker flashiness index to screen for alteration from dams, withdrawals, or urbanization.",
  "methodContextMarkdown": "Context: C\n\nMethod: D",
  "howToMeasureMarkdown": "With flow data, compute IHA metrics and R-B and compare assessment vs reference periods; interpret departures in timing, magnitude, pulse frequency, and rise/fall rates along with low/zero-flow days. Without a gage, use qualitative indicators of flashiness, dryness, and flow-duration class from field evidence, imagery, and local observations.",
